Social Login extension for Joomla CMS.
=======
This extension enables social login on a Joomla website letting users log in through their existing IDs such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Vkontakte and over 15 more! Social Login eliminates long registration process i.e. filling up a long registration form, verifying email ID, remembering another username and password so your users are just one click away from logging in to your website. Other than social login, LoginRadius's Social Login also includes User Profile Data and Social Analytics.
